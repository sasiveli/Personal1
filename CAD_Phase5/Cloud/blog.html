                <span style="margin-left: 35px;">Nestled in the scenic Western Ghats, Kutralam (குற்றாலம்) is a popular tourist destination of South Tamil Nadu. Courtallam or Kutralam is a town situated at a height of 160 m (520 ft) above sea level in the foothills of the Western Ghats in Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu, India. The very name of the place has become synonymous with the thundering waterfalls that flow here. It is also home to centuries old ancient temples and other famous places of interest. Several seasonal and perennial rivers such as Thamirabarani, Manimuthar, Pachaiyar and Chittar originate in this lush region.

                    The title “Spa of South India” fits perfectly for Kutralam due to the numerous magnificent waterfalls and the healing and medicinal properties of the water that flows here. This has led to the rise of numerous health resorts in and around this quaint town. The falls do not flow throughout the year and are highly dependent on rainfall. They carry substantial amounts of water when the rivers feeding the falls receive heavy rain. The best time to visit Kutralam is from June to September, when the South West Monsoon kicks off in the nearby state of Kerala. People are not allowed to bathe when the falls are flooded due to heavy rainfall.
